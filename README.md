I tend to get carried away when building things ":tent: > :japanese_castle:"  
One colourscheme turns into 3 potential themes, which turn into 10 could-be layouts that progress into 42 substantial threads of ideas.
Following the threads is fun, **it's tying the loose ends that's difficult** :twisted_rightwards_arrows:  
But I got there :smiley:

My inspiration for the theme that I settled on is linked above :arrow_up:  
It was an interesting choice for me as I tend to settle on much more muted colours, but an opportunity to play with light, glow, and flicker style effects was too good to pass up :sunrise:  
Plus I love making things interactive (**game design gets me excited!**), and I'll never say no to a challenge.  

Everything on my webpage was built by myself from the ground up, with the exception of the SVGs in the background (but the floating animations were my work!)  
I usually test out my ideas in other locations first, here are some very rough sketches:  
*(warning: messy code ahead)*
- [landing animation](https://codepen.io/2sexi4skool/pen/abvXred)
- [progress bars](https://codepen.io/2sexi4skool/pen/xxOJZaP)
- [icon click animations](https://codepen.io/2sexi4skool/pen/vYKpdyJ)
- [floating orbs](https://codepen.io/2sexi4skool/pen/eYdzRrw)

I hope you enjoy playing around with my website, I had a great time building it.  
Also check it out on mobile, the orbs will have a different animation when you tap them with your finger :blush:
